      <p>
        I have decided to share a couple of facts about me. I was born in
        Ukraine. I used to work as an English teacher for many years.Two years
        ago I gave a birth to my son, so now I am on maternity leave. Because of
        war I had to leave my city in spring 2022, as Russians were in 20 km
        away from my home,they were too close. I moved to Germany. So one and
        half year I lived there, raised my son and learned German language.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have already got back home, to Ukraine and live in my hometown, cause
        it appeared to be unbearable to live alone, far away from husband and
        whole family. I have always been interested in coding, as I had lots of
        adult student, who wanted to learn English and they worked in this
        field. They used to share information and stories about their work and I
        understood that it is really exciting to code.
